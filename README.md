### Project Description
Developing an asynchronous React App based on a feed of data from the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). My pair coding partner, Ole Nascimento and I set about building a visually interesting and intuitive web app to  utilise a broad range of data available. <br />
I was passionate about this project as weather applications are widley understoodchose and used. Fitting my desire to work on projects which could be of use to a wider range of users as possible.
